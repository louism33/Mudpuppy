# Mudpuppy

Mudpuppy is a c++ othello / reversi program, with a number of engines included. Version 0.1 is basic, and can only be played on the command line, probably only on linux. 

On a perft command, we reach approximately 32 mnps.

The Engine is a standard minimax searcher with most of the trimmings.
